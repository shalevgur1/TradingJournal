Trading Journal application for Interactive brokers
This application is designed to help track your trading information and trading history.
This application is mainly for tracking your trading, and drawing conclusions from trading history.
The application utilizes Excel Table that is used as the UI.

The application uses Interactive Brokers python API and can operate with both TWS and IBGW (need to be configured)

Subjects addressed by this project
1. Client-Server - The application employs the IB API and adopts a client-server software architecture. In this setup, the application 
   functions as the client, while the TWS or IBGW serves as the server (acting as a bridge to the Interactive Brokers remote servers).
2. Multi-Threading - The application leverages the Python Multi-Threading software architecture to facilitate concurrent operations.
3. API Interaction - This project engages with the Interactive Brokers API. Throughout the project, I acquired knowledge about the Interactive Brokers API and software architecture, actively utilizing and interacting with it for my specific needs.

For more information see the attached charts (Threads chart and SW architecture chart) in the application's folder.
